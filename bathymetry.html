        <h1>About this dataset:-</h1>
        <p>
            Beneath the waters of the world's ocean, the Earth's<br>
             surface isn't flat like the bottom of a glass or large<br>
              bowl. There are giant mountain ranges and huge cracks <br>
              where the ocean floor is ripping apart. Underwater<br>
               volcanoes are slowly building up into mountains that <br>
               may one day rise above the sea surface as islands.<br>
                Because of these features, the depth of the water<br>
                isn't the same everywhere in the ocean. Bathymetry is<br>
                 the measurement of how deep the water is at various places and <br>
                 the shape of the land underwater. In these maps, different shades <br>
                 of color represent different water depths. The data come the <br>
                 General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, produced by the<br>
                  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the United Nations'<br>
                   (UNESCO) Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).
