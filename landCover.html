        <h1>About this dataset:-</h1>
        <p>Maps help us understand where things are. Scientists use satellites to make <br>
            maps of many different things on Earth to help them understand our world and<br>
             how our world is changing. Judging by what the land surface looks like,<br>
              scientists organized Earth into 17 different categories. Some examples of<br>
               different types of land surface are cities, farm lands, forests, deserts, and<br>
                so forth. Using satellite observations, scientists mapped where on Earth each <br>
                of these 17 land surface categories can be found. The different colors on this<br>
                 map show the locations of each type of land surface. Scientists are monitoring<br>
                  how these land cover types change over time.
