        <h1>About this dataset:-</h1>
        <p>
            Land topography allows us to make maps of the features of <br>
            the surface of the Earth. Topographic maps show the location, <br>
            height, and shape of features like mountains and valleys, rivers,<br>
             even the craters on volcanoes. Another way to think of <br>
             topographic maps is that they are a picture of the three-dimensional<br>
              (3-D) structure of the surface of the Earth. Flat maps can create a 3-D<br>
               effect by making some parts of the map dark and other parts light.<br>
                This is called "shading" because it makes features on the surface look<br>
                 like they are casting shadows. This topographic map is made from<br>
                  data collected from three sources: NASA's Space Shuttle, Canada's<BR>
                     Radarsat satellite, and topographic maps made by the U.S. Geological Survey.
